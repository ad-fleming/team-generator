# team-generator

This application is a Node CLI that takes user input and uses that data to dynamically create a team roster that is written to an HTML file. Throughout this project, we explored Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development. Take a look below to find a link to a video demoing the app!

## Installation
The required dependencies are listed in the package.json file. Running _npm install_ will download the required packages. Following installation, navigate into the _Develop_ and run _node app.js_ to initialize the user prompts.

## Collaboration

I completed this project with the guidance of my tutor and in collaboration with my classmates.
